title 🎯 Fuzz Testing Problem for IaC Modules

rectangle "📦 Generic Module" as MOD #2874A6 {
  card "Storage Account Module\nUsed by 50+ application teams\nAccepts parameters via .tfvars" as MODC
}

rectangle "❌ Without Fuzz Testing" as BAD #C0392B {
  card "Team passes wrong region\nModule deploys to wrong location\nCompliance violation!" as BADC
}

rectangle "✅ With Fuzz Testing" as GOOD #1E8449 {
  card "Validation blocks reject input\nBuild fails BEFORE deployment\nCompliance guaranteed" as GOODC
}

MOD --> BAD : No validation
MOD --> GOOD : Variable validation + Preconditions
